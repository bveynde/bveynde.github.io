WARN 2022/07/15 16:06:46 .Path when the page is backed by a file is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We plan to use Path for a canonical source path and you probably want to check the source is a file. To get the current behaviour, you can use a construct similar to the one below:

  {{ $path := "" }}
  {{ with .File }}
        {{ $path = .Path }}
  {{ else }}
        {{ $path = .Path }}
  {{ end }}


Re-run Hugo with the flag --panicOnWarning to get a better error message.
